## Algorithms

| Algorithm                         | Description                                                                                                           | Big O     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Linear Search**                     | A simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.                      | O(n)      |
| **Binary Search**                     | An efficient algorithm that divides a sorted list into two halves and narrows down the search range by comparing values.| O(log n)  |
| **Depth-First Search (DFS)**           | A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.                    | O(V + E)  |
| **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**         | Another graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the same depth level before moving to the next level.  | O(V + E)  |
| **A Search**                         | An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to efficiently search for a path between nodes in a graph.           | O(b^d)    |
| **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**          | A graph search algorithm that explores the least-cost path by assigning a cost to each edge.                           | O((V + E) log V) |
| **Dijkstra's Algorithm**              | A popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.             | O((V + E) log V) |
| **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)**    | A combination of depth-first search and breadth-first search that gradually increases the depth limit until the goal is found. | O(b^d) |
| **Bidirectional Search**              | An algorithm that runs two simultaneous searches, one forward and one backward, until they meet.                      | O(b^(d/2)) |
| **Jump Search**                       | A search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by making fixed steps and performing linear search in the bounded range. | O(sqrt(n)) |
| **Interpolation Search**              | A search algorithm that uses numerical estimates to find an appropriate position to search in a sorted array.           | O(log log n) |
| **Exponential Search**                | An algorithm that exponentially increases the search range until a range containing the target element is found.        | O(log n)  |
| **Red-Black Tree**                    | A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance during insertions and deletions.                            | O(log n)  |
| **Trie (Prefix Tree)**                | A tree-based data structure used for efficient searching and prefix-based operations.                                  | O(m)      |
| **Hashing**                           | A technique that maps data elements to a fixed-size array using a hash function.                                       | O(1)      |
| **Simulated Annealing**               | A probabilistic search algorithm inspired by annealing in metallurgy.                                                  | Depends on the problem |
